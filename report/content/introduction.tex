\section{Introduction}


The project is part of our CS163 (Data Structure and Algorithm) course studied in HCMUS. It helps us to reinforce what we have learned in this course as well as has the first project to work and get used to OOP design - which we will learn later in CS202 (Programming System). The outcome of this project is to create a simple visualization application that can visualize some data structures and algorithms
